0,Facebook is evil. Period. They lie repeatedly and they are a threat to the privacy of every user. The world existed before Facebook and it can survive just fine without it. The company is rotten to the core and it milks its users’ data for profit. Facebook is NOT your friend.
1,Mark Zuckerberg is a child with an adult toy... he needs to step down. He has shown he is incompetent and has no conscience.
2,Wasn’t IBM’s laptop division sold to Lenovo?
3,"Facebook users would sell their soul for a ""like"". Mark knows that."
4,"I don't blame China. Spying is an ancient part of the Great Game.

I do blame Facebook. The folks who run it, Zuckerberg included, should resign, take their billions and, for the rest of their lives, try to make amends for undermining our national security by compromising our privacy.

I would also like to see the Espionage statute amended to A) remove any liability under it for whistleblower activity and B) make accessory to cyber espionage a felony for tech executives who fail to exercise due diligence."
5,time to shut them down. Need to start a movement to get everyone off of Facebook. It would be interesting to see the sharks in the water then.
6,"I don’t believe there is a FB user that fully trusts the company. I have gone in and out of my activity on the network, and despite the recent (and future) news releases, I am keeping my account active. There is no on-line presence that is risk-free. I’m approaching 50, my parents are in their late 80s, and they love seeing the extended family pictures and “adventures” on facebook. My data being leaked for companies’ financial benefit, the potential of my “privacy” being turned upside down, those are small compared to what I would lose when it comes to keeping the risk-free smiles on my parents’ faces, and feeling one click away from sharing a glass of wine with them at the dining room table. Yes, this is what Zuckerberg is counting on. Much to my chagrin, I’m in."
7,Facebook would sell out are country for a few $$$ we all need to boycott facebook !!
8,"So TLC cries that the trump admin has a bias against Chinese companies? How about China banning Facebook, google, and many other US companies? Forcing 50% partnerships and technology transfers? Having tariffs and enormous administrative trade barriers? China has been stealing US technologies out in the open, banning US companies, and outright exploiting and abusing our businesses’ and previous administrations’ openness to work with them. Time’s up, this has to stop. now it’s time to act."
9,"Facebook appears to not have any principles of any kind. They will sell people's information to the highest bidder, and it doesn't matter to Facebook who that bidder is. Are they a totalitarian government and an enemy of the United States? Facebook can't see anything wrong with that.

Keep in mind this whole enterprise started as a way to rate the sexual attractiveness of female students at Harvard, so it's not like we should be all that surprised to find out that this company has turned out to be pure evil."
10,Trump and Facebook -- lying sellouts! I don't believe anything they say.
11,"FBI needs to take over facebook.
There must be more then what we are seeing so far. We won't know unless FBI verifies it for us.
Until then it needs to shutdown."
12,"Good lord, it's time to abandon these untrustworthy platforms that sell our personal lives and data to the highest bidder.

Watch the latest ""new and trustworty"" dishonest Facebook ads, puke into your hats, and disconnect from Big Bad Brother.

You don't need him."
13,"""Free"" social media applications make their living selling our demographic and behavioral data. The more we put in, the more they give out. They are not deliberately trying to sell our identities, it just happens incidentally."
14,"While facebook is being scrutinized during a midterm election year, other abuses across the industry continue unabated. Maybe facebook's greed will solicit a change.

The weather app on your phone or tablet that can not be disabled....its driven by a data sharing agreement between ISP's and manufacturers. Not only is personal info going to all corners of the earth, but consumers are forced to pay for the data that sends it also."
15,"Have to feel sympathy for the people who have trusted Facebook for years only to have the recent series of scandals expose how seriously they have been exploited, but anybody who took a little time out to look--really look--at what the system and it's overburden of add-ons were up to knew twelve or fourteen years ago, or even earlier, that participation was a very bad idea. It's a classic case of buyer beware, and there is no such thing as a free lunch."
16,Time to fire Sheryl? She's supposedly the brains of the operation...
17,"Anything—or as Trump would put it, ANYTHING!!!—for a buck, right Mark?"
18,"Last week I was trying to take out an ad promoting registration for a kids' sports organization where I volunteer. Facebook did not just want my credit card -- they insisted on an intrusive amount of personal information. Given their track record, that wasn't going to happen.

Every day, we see more and more signs that Facebook is a tool for the oligarchs and moneyed interests, community be damned. I like being able to wish my friends a happy birthday via Facebook and used to consider it a necessary evil...but the ""evil"" is fast overtaking the ""necessary"""
19,"I would be very interested in FB’s response to Senator Warner’s critical question.

This incident shows that we have no security policy, despite having instituted the DNI. We still have this security mess. It’s because we are a conservative nation and want to leave business alone. So they leak our data to hostile China, and government doesn’t have the authority to stop the breech, other than to haul FB VPs before its congressional committees.

And we have a questionable president of whom all of his staff are afraid, so there is no leadership on security from this president, who has leaked sensitive information to the Russians.

I don’t think that our democracy that is currently under Republican leadership, has the capability to solve its security problems."
20,Can it not be shut down? Think of all the time that could be spent profitably without it!
21,"The United States needs some kind of federal data privacy law. I'd say start with the framework adopted by Europe in its General Data Protection Regulation, but give it more free speech protections (no Right to be Forgotten)."
22,"Why is that even a surprise? Facebook will sell our data to anybody who pays or gives them access to more data in return. In fact, I'd like to challenge the Times to name even one significant mobile device manufacturer that Facebook hasn't made some kind of arrangement with. If Iran, Syria or North Korea would be home to some smartphone makers, Facebook would have made deals with those, too. That's my take on the business ethics of Facebook: National security - who cares? Privacy - forget it! Democratic elections - what for? Cyber bullying - sure, if it sells ads! and on it goes.
Facebook reminds me more and more of a malignant cancer - spreading itself and relentlessly trying to grow irrespective of the damage it causes while doing so."
23,"""Malignant Cancer"" is an excellent metaphor for The Facebook!"
24,"When will the malfeasance with Facebook end? We have one of the richest men in the world, whose company takes advantage, in more ways than one, of the 99%. Shut this company down now!"
25,"But wait!

I'm seeing all kinds of warm and fuzzy ads on TV from Facebook about how they are on my side.

I mean, it's one thing not to believe Donald Trump.

But Jeff Zuckerberg?!"
26,"For all you Facebook users...you must realize that the program was started by Zuckerberg at Harvard to categorize and scale the ""hotness"" of female undergraduates. Zuckerberg was a loser at the inception and bigger loser now. Moral: If you have a Facebook account, delete now. The company is not your friend."
27,"Worse than a den of thieves!
Facebook and Zuckerberg will sell data to anyone with a buck!
If the Chinese firm was flagged by U.S.Intelligence, can Zuckerberg and Facebook be reprimanded for dealing with the ""enemy""?"
28,"The FCC’s plan to destroy net neutrality/aka/decreasing internet consumer protections will go into effect on June 11. The Senate has already voted to reverse this disastrous plan last year, Trump supports it, and now the fight moves to the House. They are set to vote in just a few days."
29,"Just saw Ime Archibong, a Facebook executive & talking head, fielding questions about this on CNN Money. I didn't hear one straight answer during the entire 8-1/2 minutes - instead a load of double-talk about the Facebook "" experience. """
30,"Follow up story idea.... can someone write an article explaining what these privacy invasions mean for the average person? I use privacy controls, don’t use 3rd party apps on fb.... but do tag pics, sometimes use locations and “like things”. I would love the nytimes to really spell out how I can be hurt. Thank you!"
31,"This is what happens without appropriate regulations and a company driven by unmitigated greed.
Put these unpatriotic clowns out of business."
32,"My dream is that the Winklevoss twins will buy out Facebook with Bitcoin.

And rename it Face Bits."
33,Deleting my facebook account was purifying and exhilarating. I recommend everyone do the same immediately.
34,You'd have to be crazy to stay on Facebook.
35,Time to break up Facebook. They're a threat to national security and sovereignty.
36,"Wearing my “I Voted” sticker today, I am sickened by the thought that by using Facebook, I am somehow complicit in harming democracy."
37,"Facebook: ""Facebook representatives said the data shared with Huawei stayed on its phones, not the company’s servers.""

What does that even mean? How can Facebook exclude that user data were copied to Huawei's servers? They can't, and their business model rewards them for enabling and ignoring the possibility.

Stop using Facebook. It's no longer merely a personal matter, it's a geopolitical imperative."
38,For a lesson in how to get regulated... Facebook!
39,"Oh but he's such a boy wonder, aw shucks Mark, so young and innocent too. Will he have to do another dog ate my Facebook, I'm sorry tour?"
40,"What is this ""Facebook"" thing of which you speak?

It certainly isn't anything I've ever used."
41,MZ should be in jail. Fine him and his company for a few billion. Has he ever been fined? Mark has been a very naughty boy.
42,"Life's funny:
* If Zuckerberg were president, he'd be impeached for high crimes, based on this report.
* If ""president"" Trump were C.E.O of a normal publicly-held company (and not a majority stockholder), the board would summarily fire him based on his performance the past 500 days.
There's a lesson there somewhere."
43,"""You don't get something for nothing."" When friends and family are logging in, sharing, etc... I said, ""What do they charge for this service?"" I heard, ""It's free!"" ""I said, there's no such thing as a free lunch!"" Well, this is how Facebook, etc... makes their money! Wise up folks!"
44,Did you ever see a corporation take a loyalty oath to America or pledge allegiance to the flag?
45,"America! .... When these FOREIGNERS solicit you for business.... just say ""No thanks!"" .... America First."
46,"Lenin has been quoted as saying: ""The Capitalists will sell us the rope that we will use to hang them.""

Lenin's cynical comment was to point out that Capitalists care about nothing but money, about turning a profit. That Capitalists will sell-out their values, their country, their relatives ... even their own lives in pursuit of profit.

Facebook it seems has been readily living up to Lenin's view of what being a Capitalist is all about. It's clear that Facebook executives including Mark Zuckerberg didn't take a moment to consider the possible damage that could be inflicted by sharing their data with these Chinese telecom companies. Facebook was more likely interested in gaining favor with the Chinese government, getting access to the Chinese market and making money off them. Facebook behaved just exactly the way Lenin would have expected."
47,"The Facebook product is you, the user of Facebook. That is all FB has to sell to advertisers . That is exactly how Facebook gets rich or richer. I would really love to see FB disappear. I guess that's too much to hope for."
48,"Just a reminder to everyone finally getting off of Facebook to think carefully about every other social media outlet you are on and ask yourself whether or not it can easily do the same thing. I'm talking Twitter, Instagram, dating apps..."
49,I'm beginning to suspect that Facebook is more interested in making money than in helping humanity.
50,Ya think??
51,"Meantime, one year ago.....

“The future of online privacy is now in President Trump's hands.
The House of Representatives voted Tuesday to repeal Internet privacy protections that were approved by the Federal Communications Commission in the final days of the Obama administration.
The Senate voted along party lines to undo the rules last week. The resolution now goes to Trump's desk. The White House said Tuesday it ""strongly supports"" the repeal.”

http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/28/technology/house-internet-privacy-repeal..."
52,"Wait, I thought there was still a vote in the House about to happen! TheNation highlighted it in it's amazing Take Action Now section, encouraging folks to visit their representatives on Thursday:

https://www.thenation.com/article/make-sure-everyone-know-talking-puerto..."
53,*its
54,"Well, Mr. Zuckerberg might have been the smartest techie in the room, but he certainly wan't the smartest person in the room."
55,Gosh darn it. I had hoped that Mr. Zuckerberg would really care about subscribers privacy. Gosh darn it.
56,Did you really? How would he get rich if he cared.
57,"Once while discussing with LinkedIn executives, I asked whether he felt people disclosed their personal information voluntarily. He looked at me and chuckled, “Well, they do!” He was from Obama’s task force on social media."
58,"What we should seriously consider...

Multi-national corporations and digital empires ( such as Facebook , Google, Microsoft) are making deals for which a small group of people.... irrespective of nationality or origin are banning together for global control. Maybe we should consider if the end game for these multi-nationals and digital empires are to build a global network of tyranny.

Mr. Zuckerberg is a dangerous, greedy, and unprincipled man. I've said this for two years in the NYT comments section: You can live without Facebook, but Facebook could survive without its users for a minute.

WAKE-UP"
59,"So, with all the waffling that Zuck has been doing, is he lying to us? Time for everyone to sign off on FB for the last time. Farewell FB. Where is the shame. Where is the integrity. Almost sounds like treason to me."
60,"As a young college student, I doubt Mark Zuckerberg planned to undermine the world order with his keen observation of how to blend technology and human nature. People gossip. People love to gossip about their nearest and dearest peeps. People love to share their opinions. Uploading a recipe or cat video or selfie is a joy. We are social after all and “social media”allows us to socialize in an international way. There is no way to turn back the clock, but there is a reckoning coming. Evil people will use whatever means they can to gain power. Zuckerberg handed them the tool."
61,Let me see if I understand... People put their information on Facebook... on the internet... and now they're upset that someone has access to their information?
62,"signing onto Facebook is making a deal with the devil. You lose your time, privacy - and, yes, your soul."
63,"Like many a good capitalist, Zuckerberg built a business model that was dependent on the resource of willful idiocy. Every country in the world is overflowing with endless deposits of that resource.
Our political leaders will not hold him accountable because they depend on our stupidity, as well."
64,These comments seem to ignore the fact that these companies are competing on an global basis. It would be shocking to me if Facebook treated these companies any differently than others cell phone makers. The company mentioned is the third largest cell phone makers in the world.
65,So competition makes sharing data OK?
66,"After the Chinese and Cambridge Analytica data breaches, Facebook should be made to pay multiple $billions into US social security and healthcare to help relieve the debt the GOP made for their tax cuts to the top .1% and to make up for the GOP inheritance tax cut in which they do not have to pay on their earnings."
67,"Between helping Russia swing the election and giving massive amounts of data to China, its reasonable to ask what value Facebook has to the American citizen? Clearly at this point the costs outweigh the benefits. If you want to keep in touch with friends and family why not just call them?"
68,"I got off of Facebook many years ago. Although I had limited myself to only family and close friends, I still got tired of seeing and reading a lot of nonsense.

But I also was concerned with all of the personal information and photos that were posted. I told people that based on what I saw, I could rob their homes when I knew they were on vacation, and I could stalk and entice their kids to go somewhere with me. I knew what they looked like, their names, school, activities, etc.

Their jobs, what they recently bought, where they socialized, what they liked to eat, and so on was all available. But the problem for us all is that now a person doesn't need to be on Facebook anymore to be tracked. If you have just one person in your contacts who is on Facebook, then they have you and everyone in your contacts and your contacts’ contacts and so on. We are all somewhere on the dark web..."
69,"Wow that's really depressing. So neither of us really protected ourselves in the end, nor did anyone else who got off of Facebook years ago. I knew there was a chance the odd photo of me would still show up there, but since I wasn't on it, no one could tag me, so I thought I was safe..."
70,"lol, you are assuming honest people posting honest information in honest profiles.

Tom Harrison is not my real name and I usually shave off about 20 years. The pics may or may not be me:) And like Trump, I am not gonna release any tax returns that might bring into question how little I actually make:)

Sell my info. It ain't worth much."
71,Zuckerberg will go on another apology tour- to China.
72,"Facebook ""shared"" our data with the Chinese government---courtesy of Huawei, a Chinese telecom flagged by the US government???

Facebook outright SOLD our data to Cambridge Analytica, backed by hedge fund magnate Robert Mercer, to elect Donald Trump???

Facebook helped Russian intelligence during the 2016 Presidential election, with trolls who supported Trump and spread conspiracy rumors about Hillary?

Anyone see any patterns here???"
73,"They didn't 'share' - they provided it as part of agreements that got them money.

I believe Google is political. Facebook just sells everything to the highest bidder and could care less about anything else.

If anything, Silicon Valley leans pretty hard left. But it is money that far outweighs any other consideration."
74,"I would like to bring Mr. Snowden home and send the facebook traitor to Russia.- who, incidentally does not have enough cash to entice me to use his product. But I bet I am still in his data system."
75,I think Facebook has about run its course.
76,I've had it and just now permanently deleted my Facebook account. Thanks a lot Facebook and to think I once trusted you.
77,I deleted mine 3 weeks ago. Haven’t missed it!
78,Perhaps this is the real Bonfire of the Vanities.
79,"Facebook tends to make you see things you don't want to see and refuse to show others things you'd like them to see. This conundrum is further made a mystery by the other reality that maybe specific others don't want to see what I want them to see while specific political guided miscues whether the Russians, the Chinese or the NRA are non-negotiable without your expressed written consent."
80,"FB wanted the business and had no oversight. Americans blindly trust that US companies have a patriotic sense of duty. This gets obscured and forgotten when there’s $billions to be made in a relatively short amount of time.

There’s been 2 generations since WWII. At that time, almost every able bodied American united and joined in the War Effort to save Democracy, which we take for granted now. But the people have to work to keep it that way. Cyber security is as big a threat as any bomb during WWII, and even worse as it can effect financial institutions, infrastructure and energy grids.

The most confusing thing to me is that Trump ignores multinational cyber security experts from the US and EU, including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. regarding use of Chinese ZTE components in existing telecommunication devices due to potential risks. And with Trump’s unilateral reversal, this could allow components that threaten US security to gain market shares over Apple and Samsung using 5G networks. Huawei Technologies Co., which was labeled a cyberspying threat by a U.S. congressional committee in 2012."
81,"Small government = business with no oversight.
It is why no serious government is small."
82,"Why did Facebook give these private companies and foreign companies access and did Facebook get paid? or what did Facebook get for giving up private information? I hope they pay for this.

I want to sign up for the class action."
83,"If this revelation does not persuade folks to delete their accounts on facebook, nothing will do so. Be rid of social media, and discover the real meanings of friends and relationships."
84,"I quit Facebook a month ago after reading about all the deaths in Malaysia between adversarial party fighting due to FB disinformation campaigns.

I want nothing to do ever again with anything even remotely connected to with Mark Zuckerberg a or Cheryl Sandberg."
85,"Thank you for supporting FB while the Malaysia thing was happening, though."
86,"Recognize that tech companies like Google and Facebook care absolutely nothing about American citizens or our privacy.

Everyhting is for sale to the highest bidder.

End all tax breaks and extended worker import programs (Chinese?) now - these companies do not operate in the American interest."
87,Quick question... When should I expect to receive my class action notification?
88,"People like Trump, Zuckerberg, and other money slaves will do anything for money and fame including compromising the national security and people of the United State."
89,Apple also is closely allied to the communist Chinese government and has shown itself over and over again to be NOT interested in helping protect America from its enemies.
90,"That is what ""globalization"" is all about. In 2004 (14years ago), john Kerry talked about ""Benedict Arnold CEOs"" and no one listened to him. Now it is all outrage."
91,"Zuckerberg needs to take some time away from the company to reflect on what it means to be honest, trustworthy, and an American, and then he needs to resign. Facebook needs to be broken up."
92,"Social media in general, and Fakebook in particular, is about destroying the fabric of civilized society by converting into warring tribes, like in Afghanistan, for the benefit of social media owners and their allies, Russia and China."
93,Glad I never put my mug and personal information on Facebook. Figured sooner or later somebody would use it against me.
94,"How many more articles like this do we need for people to get off of Facebook? Honestly. I'm finding it harder and harder to feel sorry for anyone still on it. I predicted all of this years ago, got off of it and everyone laughed at me for being ""dramatic"" and ""paranoid.""

Who's laughing now?"
95,"Ditto. I've never been on Facebook despite the relentless dunning of people who poked fun. I'm also paranoid, or so they say. Whatever information Facebook has about me -- and it's plenty -- came through Facebook mining their information without my knowledge.

btw - I use Firefox and watch the little box on the lower left of the page that tells me what's being downloaded along with the page I requested. Facebook *always* shows along with the usual clutter like doubleclick.

We don't need a Big Brother watching us. Facebook is making a fine surrogate."
96,"@Patricia and Humanesque: Also check out the Privacy Badger browser add-on from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (and maybe throw them a few bucks).

I left FB after Cambridge Analytica, but I've used Privacy Badger for a year or more. It keeps FB and Twitter from following you around the web, and it blocks spying ads and invisible trackers."
97,"It's ok everyone, Facebook said none of the data was accessed off of the phones so I'm sure the Chinese government didn't get anything."
98,oh the sarcasm
99,"If The Zuck said it it must be true. The Duke of Wellington was greeted by a man who said, Mr. Jones (or Smith, whatever) I believe; Wellington responded ""If you believe that, you will believe anything."""
100,"Well, our Prez, contrary to all advice from the intelligence services and many members of the Senate, is out smoozing ZTE. With a doozy of a $500 million loan from China to buy the crook’s cooperation, Chinese slippers rather than Russian jack boots might be running America then Facebook will be completely put out of business."
101,"So it is illegal for US companies to transfer certain technology to China and other countries, but Facebook is allowed to sell its user’s personal data to them? Was Zuckerberg asked about these deals at his hearing last month? If so, were his replies consistent with what’s explained in the article? If China’s security services use the data for nefarious purposes, will Zuckerberg compensate the victims for their injuries? Facebook’s behavior is utterly inconsistent with their tv ads which claim that their sole goal is to connect the people of the World... Congress needs to have him back to testify and have social media experts ask the questions."
102,Huawei is a threat to the US national security? What a joke. You want to know who spies on us? Facebook and Google. Not Huawei. Why aren't Facebook and Google flagged as a threat to US national security??
103,"Your statement is at odds with our government's warnings >

<blockquote>China has the means, opportunity, and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes.
Chinese intelligence collection efforts against the U.S. government are growing in “scale, intensity and sophistication.”12 Chinese actors are also the world’s most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage.13 U.S. private sector firms and cyber- security specialists report an ongoing onslaught of sophisticated computer network intrusions that originate in China, and are almost certainly the work of, or have the backing of, the Chinese government.14 Further, Chinese intelligence services, as well as private companies and other entities, often recruit those with direct access to corporate networks to steal trade secrets and other sensitive proprietary data.</blockquote>"
104,"No - Huawei spies pretty extensively on US citizens at the behest of the Chinese government much as the Russians use Kaspersky anti-virus.

That doesn't make Facebook any less of a concern but don't lose sight of the threat of foreign technology companies operating in support of foreign governments."
105,"Econ 101 :

Since 2009 Facebook has been blocked in China. No global company wishes to be excluded from the vast Chinese Market of one billion Internet users.

In 2014 , Zuckerberg tried a charm offensive , addressing for 20 min in Mandarin an audience at Tsinghua, China's premier technology and business University. In July 2014, Bloomberg News reported that Facebook signed a three-year lease last spring to rent more than 8,600 square feet of office space in Beijing's central business district.

Charm does not get you anywhere in China. Deals do.

More generally:

The US population still needs to learn that in a global society, ""US Firms"" are global companies - not US ones.

Including firms bailed out by US tax payers. In 2017, GM
sold 4.04 million vehicles in China , a third more than the 3.002 million the company sold in the United States. To get such access, its cutting edge research is carried out jointly with China's automotive industry, handing over US knowledge to the PRC.

106,"Don't worry, I'm sure Zuckerberg is sorry."
107,"I have never had the urge to jump on the facebook or twitter bandwagons or any of the other similar sites. Joining a forum for BBQ is about as risky as I am willing to chance. Seems to me that social sites are full of busy bodies snooping into each others lives, bragging about their own adventures and piling on when the mood suits them. Users are making a hand full of people very VERY wealthy. And powerful. Both are attributes that can be misused."
108,"Ironically, it looks like the Chinese were right to ban Facebook in China afterall."
109,"Zuckerberg should be in prison.

ENOUGH!!!"
110,"I dream daily of awakening to find the infatuation with tech hipsterism dead. I work with the technology on a daily basis, and have for nearly 35 years as an aerospace software systems engineer. Yet I know my opinions are not popular, at least not with the business/marketing folks, nor the general public who eat the buzzword PR up and regurgitate it as supposedly ‘tech savvy’ truth. If you want to know where 'fake news' started, then look no further than the tech industry. Most people take everything the collective industry says as gospel, but never question the motives; those telling 'us' what to believe, are the very ones profiting hand over fist if we buy into their propaganda – yeah, slight conflict of interest, but people are so awed by the bells and whistles, the shiny, that they are complete suckers for it all. The tech industry is seen as progressive, trendy, hipster, with a whiff of libertarianism thrown in for an iconoclastic edge. Nonsense! The industry is closer to what the 'old' stereotypes would have held: the antithesis of progressive, hiding behind the bogus façade of ‘libertarianism,’ selfish and greedy beyond defense. They want your data, so they can sell you as product. They encourage the belief that hacking is cool, when in fact it is the realm of petty criminals and obtuse script kiddies. Please, stop buying into the lies – technology is nothing more than a tool, helpful but no panacea for humanity, and rife with problems."
111,Great post! Thank you!
112,"Infatuation indeed!
I know a couple of people that can't drive anywhere without help from their car's satnav. One got lost because his satnav couldn't accept ""Maccas"" as a destination in a nearby town (""Maccas"" is common Aussie abbreviation for MacDonalds)."
113,"There was a recent news report about teenagers leaving Facebook in droves. It is time for adults to do the same thing and delete the Facebook app from their devices. There is no need to breakup Facebook, just watch it vanish like MySpace."
114,Wonderful yet reckless technology. Any monetary fines as outcome should be given to FB users.
115,"Yes America, you can trust Facebook to guard your information and privacy because...it's so easy to use and Zuckerberg seems so nice and hip and it doesn't cost me any money and I just don't care about the privacy of my friends, parents, spouse or even my children.

We have become a nation of lazy fools."
116,Follow the money.
117,"Facebook should never have been trusted with private information. No one imagined Facebook would find mysterious revenue sources that we are only now finding out what they were. We never before wondered how Facebook growth was financed besides stock holders. In reality Facebook was not really free even though we all enjoyed being Facebookers for free. I should have stuck to my principle that nothing that is free is worth anything. Anyway since I did not place any private information and asked not to share information with anyone other than carefully selected friends, I am not too worried. But the federal government should worry and appoint a special prosecutor to find out about the collusion between Facebook and all those who were getting secret information."
118,"This is what is destroying our democracy - not Russia, not China, but the American system of law - one law for the rich, and another for the rest of schlubs. Why isn't Mark Zuckerberg doing a perpetrator walk for treason? Theft? Fraud?

I bet that any Democrat and any Republican can find one point of agreement: we are sick of the rich getting away with breaking any law they choose and facing no consequences. Pollution? Check. Insider trading? Check. Extortion for necessary to life medicines? Check. Violating labor laws, even to the point of killing workers? Check. Poisoning water? Check. Destroying the country's economy and getting bailed out instead of paying bail? Check. Tax evasion to the tune of billions? Check. When will we Republicans, Democrats, and Independents start working together - these people are destroying everything for ALL OF US."
119,"Yes, Barbara, and it's pathetic that when these kinds of things happen, the cost is on the backs of people like you and me, as if WE did something wrong. It's time for one set of real laws for everyone, term limits and recalls of ALL elected officials who do not abide by the will of the majority, and when I say majority, I do not mean those with the MAJORITY of the money."
120,Why don't we start with Trump who has done/does/or wishes he could many of these things and now is claiming that he is truly ABOVE the law?
121,Isn't aiding and abetting espionage a crime called sedition?
122,"Facebook MUST be broken up into smaller distinct entities.
Now."
123,"Revoke Facebook’s right to operate in the US as a US company. Label them a national security threat, and let them move to Ireland, or any other tax haven they wish. And ban all Chinese companies from operating in the US as well, as they are all tools of the communist dictatorship. And drastically cut down the number of Chinese students and workers in the US. Most of them are Xi supporters, and are collectively helping bring about a greater, imperial China."
124,"No, jail the executives and confiscate their assets."
125,"Do you know how much money they give to politicians? That will never happen, the law doesn't apply when it stops lawmakers from making money."
126,"I deleted my Facebook account in November, and it’s increasingly depressing to learn it didn’t protect me or my family."
127,I thought Trump wanted to help ZTE. That isn't mentioned in the article.
128,"He didn't really - just trying to avoid having the trade war spiral out of control.

I wish people could focus on the real issue in this case - tech giants importing foreign workers, violating our privacy in ways most people don't realize, and having no interest in supporting the country - all they care about is money and its time we clearly stated that."
129,"Ah, but Cambridge Analytica is the bad guy. Ahahahahahahahahaha. Hypocrite much, Facebook?"
130,"Maybe data mining isn't as harmless as it seems or is portrayed to us. It's time for the United States to get back into the business of making some of its own electronics/technical devices. It's long past time for OUR data and privacy to be protected. Businesses do not need as much data as they claim. In fact less data might produce some better products because we'd have less niche marketing and companies would be forced to appeal to a broader group. I'm tired of being told that I have to allow ""cookies"" or have a lesser experience on line. I'm tired of being asked irrelevant questions or for my email address just to access a site to check information.

If Congress cannot cooperate long enough to protect Americans privacy, data, and credit card numbers, or force companies to take privacy more seriously they don't deserve to be in office. Data sharing is not a benevolent activity. Nor is identity theft. It hurts real people all the time."
131,"The Senate voted last year to reverse net neutrality against millions of consumer complaints to NOT reverse it. It basically reduces online privacy. Pai really had no justification to do it. Trump really encouraged the vote. At the time Bannon was on the NSC and was working with Cambridge Analytica too.

Now the vote is coming next week to the Congress. Wonder what the GOP will do with it after the news of all the Facebook breaches which affect national security?"
132,"Users don't care about their data and most of us gave up (or had taken away) our privacy years ago in the name of ""security"". Facebook is a business and they're gonna do whatever it takes to make money, duh. And no one is going to do anything significant about it because the people in government, of any party, are there to protect the interests of business who in turn keep people sedated with social media and entertainment, big gas guzzling automobiles and and tokens of dividends. Huawei won't worry, Trump will work with Xi to make it all better."
133,What a depressingly accurate comment.
134,"While these ongoing disturbing revelations are the direct result from having an advertising based business model, and not the technology, it’s frighteningly overdue for Congress to insist on a third party algorithm audit. With the exception of Facebook, Google, Twitter, and the rest of the Silicon Valley ilk, every advertising/media vehicle used within the advertising industry:TV, Radio, newspapers, magazines, etc. are subjected to rigorous third party audits. Not until that rock is lifted, will we know all the slithering things being withheld and lied about by Facebook. It’s time for Congress to knock it off with the ineffectual hearings and sound bites, understand the gravity of the situation, take the action needed, and have a third party group, that understands the complexity of this issue, lift up the hood and dismantle if needed."
135,"I think that wider net has to be cast in Silicon Valley on those who profit off helping repressive regimes. Companies such as Cisco helped build an internet firewall in China to help the government control and censor data.

https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/ciscos-latest-attempt-dodge-respon...

“Cisco custom-built the so-called “Great Firewall of China,” also known as the “Golden Shield.” This system enables the Chinese government to conduct Internet surveillance and censorship against its citizens. As if that weren’t bad enough, company documents also revealed that, as part of its marketing pitch to China and in an effort to meet its customers needs, Cisco built a special Falun Gong module into the Golden Shield that helped the Chinese authorities identify, locate, and ultimately persecute practitioners of that religion by, for example, creating profiles of them that could be used during interrogations and forced conversions (i.e., torture).”"
136,"Oh but wait, Trump wants to protect Chinese jobs so ZTE has been given a reprieve. I am sure that is what middle America elected Trump to do. To be hard on Canada and Europe but to embrace China. Not!"
137,"And to embrace Putin, Duterte and any other dictator he can find."
138,Trying to prevent a trade war from spiraling out of control isn't really support....measured pressure makes sense.
139,"...and we continue to support corporations and their big influence on politics with outsized donations ....
...and how many other companies do this? do we really think Netflix with its market research, Google, Amazon are all ""saints""?"
140,"And, according to FB officials, 'the data shared with Huawei stayed on its phone'. Which phone & who says? Oh, Facebook officials . . . . , that phrase joins 'the check is in the mail."
141,"If Facebook is free, then the product is YOU!"
142,"I attended a lecture on privacy given by a professor from the University of NC School of Law (who is undoubtedly one of the few people to ever read the FB privacy policy in toto) as Mr. Zuckerberg was testifying before Congress. In the Q&A afterwards I asked her if she could pose one question to Mark Zuckerberg, what would it be. She paused for a moment and then said, “What will your next business model be?” I’m ALMOST beginning to have hope that he may soon have to give that a tiny bit of thought."
143,"Whether this is a big deal or not, it's troubling how lucrative consumers have become as the product, and more troubling how all this big data can be used to disrupt the sovereignty of countries.
There is simply nothing humans won't monetize to make a buck."
144,"There is one thing I can think of that hasn't been monetized, and I'd estimate it's worth a (profane profanity tirade here) incomparable fortune.

Other than that, you're absolutely right."
145,"Vladimir Lenin is reputed to have said "" Capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them."" True in 1918 and still true today in 2018
Good job there, Comrade Zuckerberg!"
146,".... sorry but too populist quote fro me-
in former eastern block communists sold people with everything and a rope
...Facebook is till not even on that planet"
147,And they will sell every inch of ground. Then they will realize that you can't eat money. Then what happens?
148,"OK, NYTimes editorial board--where is your instant opinion on this matter? Too busy chasing after Trump's Russian ghosts? So the four companies ""promised"" FB that they only saved the data on the devices, not the servers? Is there a BIG difference? I learned long ago not to put too much info on FB (I not only keep my birthdate confidential--I hope--but I lied about it anyway.) Not long ago, I deleted a lot of my personal info anyway. I will read and comment on my friends' posts on FB, but I seldom post anything on my personal site. I still get annoyed when some family members post photos of their children; I've warned them about the implications, but those family members are younger than me and don't fear the technology."
149,You can't fool Facebook as long as you use them at all.
150,"So after being implicated in Russian interference in the 2016 election, both as a provider of user data and a transmitter of fake news to its subscribers, making the apologies to Congress, Facebook has basically shared info on many millions of American and foreign users with the Chinese government. Now both communist powers can play with our democracy. Also great for recruitment of spies against America and whatever foreign nations other Facebook users live in. How much profit will Facebook reap for selling out the West? And if you believe that Facebook's 'safeguards' to keep data being moved to company and government servers is any better than their safeguards to prevent the author of the British survey transferring all the stolen data to Cambridge Analytics and the Trump campaign, then you are truly gullible. They never even checked how the data was used/shared in the Cambridge case. It's hard to imagine how they could possibly have prevented the data being moved to company/government servers. Surely the Chinese military has those capabilities. They are very adept at hacking, so that should be a piece of cake for them. Just another case of effectively, kind of treason for profit by Facebook."
151,"Notwithstanding all of his brilliance...either didn't know or didn't care about either national security, cyber security, nor users' security. All of those things have been ongoing for years, now, from hacked credit cards, years ago.

Bet the Chinese and the Russians now know plenty, and our national security is imperiled.

...Anything for money, Zuck! It was too good to be true.

That is why these companies need federal regulation to protect their clients.

Sooner rather than later!"
152,"You really think he's brilliant?

I'm not sold. He stole the idea from those blue-blood twins, paid them off after he made it what it is today.

Having no grasp at all of how the thing was built, I can see someone with moderate coding skill hiring much more capable people to build something and then appoint one's self head honcho while the talent continues to produce for great salaries, stock options, ridiculous retirements by the age of 40, and so on.

Then again, Steve Jobs is currently compared to Einstein in certain circles."
153,Stole the idea. Sure.
154,"This should be treated as a data breach, with credit monitoring offered to all impacted individuals. Let's hope that Trump's FTC is up to the enforcement task at hand."
155,"I doubt the credit agencies are capable of monitoring hundreds of millions or billions of accounts.

""Big data"" was a popular term not so long ago. The impression talk of it gave was, it's all under control.

I would bet it isn't."
156,"I'm sure the Chinese Communist Party ""likes"" Mr. Zuckerberg a whole bunch."
157,"Hey, maybe this could be the spark that joins California and China in a single, non United States entity.

I would find that hilarious."
158,"That's pretty much already happening. Huge swaths of the Bay Area are being purchased two Chinese real estate companies, constantly trying to outbid one another while no American company can even begin to compete (not that an American real estate company would necessarily have better intentions...They all have the same intention, which is simply to make money)."
159,"Where in the heck is Facebook’s sense of urgency?They’ll “wind it down” by the end of the week?!?

I am so glad I quit the platform!"
160,"Reminds me of when I would ask the kids if they washed their hands for dinner when they sat down at table. They would say yes, then run into the bathroom before I got a chance to inspect."
161,"I just deleted my Facebook membership, if you want to call it that, and I am happier now than I was before.
Zuckerberg is just like trump and his cohorts. Greedy. It's beyond greedy. This is unconscionable that he would sell our information to our enemies.
Apology definitely not accepted."
162,"Congratulations, and may others follow your example."
163,Is it me or is Facebook a national security threat?
164,"Facebook, our BFF. Two-faced-book would be more accurate. Peddling our personal data to foreign businesses, and by association, foreign governments shows Mark Zuckerberg's true allegiance: filling the coffers of Mark Zuckerberg."
165,"It's high time, if he hasn't done so already, to liquidate some of his net worth.

No one ever said that anything on the internet is guaranteed to survive. If I had to guess on internet thing that can't fail right now, it would be baseball-reference.

Some social media site? My hope is, eventually the people -- mostly young -- who use it constantly will get bored of it. There is some possibility that can happen.

It's not like anything new and groundbreaking happens on facebook."
166,"Again I ask this question, what real good has ever come from Fakebook?"
167,"Does Facebook take us as a bunch of blithering idiots? Yes, their side of the app may reside on the device. How much do you want to bet the “data sharing” agreement gives the Chinese access to the data structures and everything they need to build an app that transfers data from the device to their servers in the background?

The data can be used in conjunction with phishing attacks and password guessing to hack into unsuspecting accounts. Since FB collects data from other people’s accounts, FB put otherwise careful people and companies at risk.

This goes to show the fundamental fallacy of the Hobby Lobby decision: the best we can expect from for profit corporations is for them to be amoral.

So long as FB users think the service is free they will continue to be its product. Until FB implements a paid subscription option with zero data collection or ads, they simply cannot be trusted with user data. They have multi billion dollar incentives to monetize user data.

The next time American corporations request special treatment or protection, we MUST remember that modern multinationals have neither patriotic loyalty nor any moral imperative beyond “maximizing shareholder value” (thank you Milton Friedman)."
168,Time to distrust Zuckerberg.
169,Now with comrade Trump at the helm we might as well all throw up our hands and surrender.
170,"Why does this come as a surprise? As the world gets smaller and more connected, and American Capitalism is encouraged to spread its tentacles on a global scale, we can’t expect multinational organizations like Facebook, Microsoft, Exxon, Accenture, Google, Amazon, et. to have any loyalty to United Stated security interests. These companies are in it for the all mighty $ and how many $ they can deliver to their shareholders."
171,"No one should use Facebook. Aside from fraudulently selling our personal information, they are committing treason, as long as the price is right. Don't we have any laws in the country to punish this kind of activity?"
172,Is there anyone Facebook didn't give access to our information to?
173,NO. Noone.
174,"Greed. It is never enough. They just have to have more and they don’t care who they hurt.

Done with Facebook"
175,"Sorry, your privacy will matter to us by the end of the week."
176,"To protect your information, and to protest Zucerberg's egregious betrayal, closing Facebook accounts are worth considering. The promise that each member determines what is shared is a sham.

Nothing is safe with Facebook and, by Facebook's lack of integrity, participation is denied. How often has the public been assured, 'that it's being handled'?

The promise of the internet is reduced to pleas to buy, buy, buy."
177,"These headlines are hyperbolic and unnecessarily scaring/angering people! Stop already!

FB essentially gave other companies access to their programming APIs so that FB could be integrated with the software on the phones. Sharing API access for software integrations is common practice in almost all areas of the software industry. This is NOT as big of a deal as these non-tech savvy authors are making it out to be. Geesh!"
178,"why do the other companies need to know the list of my friends and my education level for this, Paul? Makes no sense."
179,"Paul

I am relieved there's one of your superior wisdom and seen-it-all tech savvy.

Could you please explain this quote ""...retrieve detailed information on both device users and all of their friends — including work and education history, relationship status and likes""?

And maybe a word or two on why this is a fine thing for users (and all of their friends)."
180,"We need a Teddy Roosevelt of our time to go after Facebook, Google, Amazon.

These companies have too much power, and are driven only by their financial interests.

Time to break up these monopolies.

Time to regulate them and lock them up."
181,I agree with Apple's Tim Cook when he said if they can't self-regulate then we need actual legislation to keep them in line.
182,"Nothing about this company seems straight or clean, and that includes Zuckerberg."
183,"After Cambridge Analytica broke, I deleted my FB account. My life is better for losing this insidious, time-wasting app, and I encourage you to do the same."
184,"Virtually every tech company that does business in China is being forced to give up secrets to them. And what they haven't forced the disclosure of ""legally"" they have stolen from our servers. This is the bigger story. Maybe the Times would care to look into it. To bash Facebook like this without context is disingenuous."
185,"Too big to fail or be fired? I think not.

Drop your Facebook account like I did four years ago!"
186,"What I find amazing is how little traction this seems to be getting with the American public. It seems absolutely incredible that most of America believes that anything our government does, any data our government collects and anything our government touches is evil incarnate. But private industry..... that is a different matter. But ya know, we can't get in the way of private business. And, heaven forbid, don't take away or regulate my Facebook/Twitter!!! How would we know what presidential/republican policy is?"
187,Now that we know that Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook collaborated and conspired with both China and Russia against the privacy interests and values of America and Americans what are we going to about it?
188,Facebook... giving data to Chinese firms flagged by the US gov't when the Chinese people don't even have the freedom to use Facebook.
189,"Of course they did! All Facebook account holders, you've been Zucked ....

It wasn't bad enough that the Russians were given the keys to influence/manipulate our elections?"
190,"Actually, it is not just Facebook account holders: anybody that has you as a contact in their phones could have leaked your information."
191,Told you so. Put down the Facebook. Get a life.
192,"Hardly surprising. Capitalism generates energy and is capable of an enormous economic good, but, think nuclear reactor, if you leave it unregulated it destroys everything."
193,"The USA goes to other countries and purchase companies, thinking they have the right to do it. Although, when foreign companies attempted to do the same, the USA claims it could harm national security?"
194,Does anyone really believe that Huawei did not build a device that loaded data like a phone or a blackberry and then sent it to their servers? Facebook executives need to stop trying to minimize their colossal blunders.
195,If they are indeed blunders.
196,"It's really up to us as social media consumers (or, rather, those of us consumed by social media) to shut FaceBook down.

At least for a time -- at least through the midterms.

We can still take pictures of the food we're eating, and send them around later."
197,"""Grampa, can you tell me about privacy? I don't understand the concept..."""
198,"And Facebook sold us out in 2016 by selling our data to Russia.
I thought Mark Zuckerberg was an American citizen. Silly me."
199,Zuck an American? Right.
200,"Soxared, that's an unfair low blow. There are plenty of American citizens who do far more harm to this country than Zuckerberg. You know who many of them are. Still, they are citizens."
201,"Well, there goes Zuckerberg as CEO."
202,I certainly hope so. And he must be replaced by someone who will sell us all down the river.
203,You wish...
204,"Hey Zuckerberg
time to roll out the apology bandwagon again. You've been crying wolf for so long, we no longer believe ANYTHING you utter.Disgusting !!!"
205,"It just keeps getting worse for FB. It's reported young people and adults are fleeing, deleting their accounts.

This is not Good."
206,This is Good. People can start doing more with their lives. People can start working in industries that do more than selling other people's information.
207,They're not joking FB because it is for old people and isn't hip. Privacy has nothing to do with it.
208,"Seriously, has Zuckerberg’s real project for this year been “work with foreign dictators to facilitate espionage”? Because that what this allows the Chinese to do. Vacuum up personal info on government employees and military personal.

Picture the worst case scenario and you better believe the Chinese took ten steps beyond that."
209,"No, in fact Facebook will continue to infiltrate, influence, spy other countries to benefit the interests of the USA government."
210,"Nothing is sacred in the market. Let’s not fool ourselves into thinking the world is still in 1960, when there we’re some kind of meaningful geographical boundaries that kept one set of circumstances locked away from the world. With the exception of North Korea, there is NOTHING stopping business (Facebook) from operating with trade allies (China.) Facebook is a global player, and China is a global player. What they chose to do in their meetings and dealings is just one of those things that, in the words of Jim Carrey, “things are just happening.” Mark Zuckerberg and his teams are not trading secrets that will bring down our nation. At worse they are exploiting the simplest side of first world populations to somehow gain more power, money, influence, and status. That’s all. This will all wash over. Nothing is sacred in the market..."
211,Money can be more powerful than the military. China's financial control and investment world-wide has given it tremendous power. An Apple a day keeps China in sway.
212,"The haven't taken ALL our dough, but they will keep trying."
